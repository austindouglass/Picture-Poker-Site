                Picture Poker is a simplified verison of poker. Both the player and dealer get 5
                cards from the deck. Your objective is to get more matches than the dealer with the
                highest priority cards. 
                <br></br>
                When the player and dealer get their cards they can choose to redraw certain cards
                in their hand or hold. In most cases it is best for the player to redraw cards that
                have no match or are low priority. The player can redraw a card by clicking it.
                However, both the player and dealer only get one chance to redraw before comparing
                cards and determining the winner.
                <br></br>
                It's important to remember that the number of matches you
                have matters more than the priority of cards. For example, 3 x's beats 2 blue 
                flames despite x's being the lowest priority card. When you have an equal number
                of matches that is when priority cards come in to determine the winner. If the 
                number of matches and priority of the card is equal we check for another match
                and repeat the process. It is possible to get a tie.
